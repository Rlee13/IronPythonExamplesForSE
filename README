The program requires Interop.SolidEdge.dll to be copied in its
folder. The DLL is part of Jason Hewell's project and can be
downloaded from http://solidedgeinterop.codeplex.com/
Tested with IronPython 2.7.4 on .NET 4.0 and Solid Edge ST6.

The files have the extension .ipy (a personal preference),
feel free to changed it to any other extension.
Simply run:
  ipy.exe filename.ipy
